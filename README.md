Remember to run supervisedNMF.m before running the reconstruction code! Select from https://www.openslr.org/12/ (Libri ASR speech) the download dev-clean.tar.gz 
and then import at least the 12 first clips from the folder 168635 if you want to use the example clips in the code! 
The naive audio reconstruction is just for demonstrative purposes.
